# UMass Boston CS410 (Introduction to Software Engineering)

This is a remote repository for all of my UMass Boston CS410 class projects and other associated files. This repository contains my solutions for each of the homework assignments and attempts at the class projects. Not all solutions here are 100% correct so view at your own discretion.

## Notes
- The Uno project from Homework 5 is strictly following the given instructions. For an expanded version which includes additional features, you can check out my Uno repository which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/BrendanNguyenCS/Uno).
- This repository doesn't contain the capstone final project for the class. That can be viewed [here](https://github.com/BrendanNguyenCS/AIPictionary). It doesn't currently work as intended in its current stage but the work done can be viewed.
